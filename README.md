###### * A preliminary implementation of Capsule Network on TensorFlow.
###### * Training and testing were performed on a single CPU in an environment with no GPU support.
###### * With adequate GPU support, further work will be added and moved to the master branch.  

##### Implementation process:
###### * Defined capsule network architecture.
###### * Acquired MNIST data sets.
###### * Split data into batches for network training.
###### * Trained the Capsule Network model.
###### * Displayed the accuracy and loss at each time step in each epoch.
